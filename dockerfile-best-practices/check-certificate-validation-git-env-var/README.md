To control SSL certificate validation in Git operations within a Docker container, you can use the `GIT_SSL_NO_VERIFY` environment variable. Setting this variable to true or 1 tells Git to bypass SSL certificate validation, which can be useful in certain situations, such as working with self-signed certificates or in a development environment. However, it's important to understand that disabling SSL certificate validation poses security risks and should be avoided in production environments.

Here's how you can enable or disable SSL certificate validation in a Dockerfile by setting the `GIT_SSL_NO_VERIFY` environment variable:

If you want to **disable SSL certificate validation** (not recommended for production), you can set `GIT_SSL_NO_VERIFY` to true in your Dockerfile:

```
FROM debian:bullseye

RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y git

ENV GIT_SSL_NO_VERIFY=true
```

**To ensure SSL certificate validation is enabled** (which is the default and recommended setting), you can explicitly set GIT_SSL_NO_VERIFY to false in your Dockerfile. This step is generally not necessary unless you have a specific reason to ensure that the environment variable is explicitly set, as Git will validate SSL certificates by default:

```
FROM debian:bullseye

RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y git

ENV GIT_SSL_NO_VERIFY=false
```
This policy checks whether you're using the `GIT_SSL_NO_VERIFY` env variable in the Dockerfile whose value is set to either *false* or *0*. This will give you passing checks else for every other scenario, you'll get failing checks. Please note that be default, the certificate validation is enabled.

**In order to test this policy, use the following commands:**

- Make sure you have `kyverno-json` installed on the machine
- Make sure you have [nctl `v3.4.0`](https://downloads.nirmata.io/nctl/downloads/) or above.


1. **Extract JSON equivalent of the dockerfile:**
    ```bash
    nctl scan dockerfile -r test/good-test/Dockerfile --show-json > payload.json
    ```

2. **Test the Policy with Kyverno:**
    ```bash
    kyverno-json scan --payload payload.json --policy check-certificate-validation-git-env-var.yaml
    ```
    a. **Test Policy Against Valid Payload:**
    ```bash
    kyverno-json scan --policy check-certificate-validation-git-env-var.yaml --payload test/good-test/good-payload.json
    ```

    This produces the output:

    ```
    Loading policies ...
    Loading payload ...
    Pre processing ...
    Running ( evaluating 1 resource against 1 policy ) ...
    - check-certificate-validation-git-env-var / check-certificate-validation-git-env-var /  PASSED
    Done
    ```

    b. **Test Policy Against Invalid Payload:**
    ```bash
    kyverno-json scan --policy check-certificate-validation-git-env-var.yaml --payload test/bad-test/bad-payload.json
    ```

    This produces the output:
    ```
    Loading policies ...
    Loading payload ...
    Pre processing ...
    Running ( evaluating 1 resource against 1 policy ) ...
    - check-certificate-validation-git-env-var / check-certificate-validation-git-env-var /  FAILED
