In a Dockerfile, you can use environment variables to customize the behavior of your application or services within the Docker container. The PYTHONHTTPSVERIFY environment variable specifically relates to Python applications running inside the container and controls how Python handles HTTPS requests' certificate verification.

If you want to disable certificate verification, you can set PYTHONHTTPSVERIFY to 0 in the Dockerfile like so:

```
ENV PYTHONHTTPSVERIFY=0
```
However, disabling certificate verification is generally not recommended as it can expose your application to security risks, such as man-in-the-middle attacks. Only disable certificate verification if you have a specific reason to do so and understand the potential risks involved.

This policy checks whether the certification validation is disabled or not. If it is disabled, the Policy will return you failing checks else passing checks.

**In order to test this policy, use the following commands:**

- Make sure you have `kyverno-json` installed on the machine
- Make sure you have [nctl `v3.4.0`](https://downloads.nirmata.io/nctl/downloads/) or above.


1. **Extract JSON equivalent of the dockerfile:**
    ```bash
    nctl scan dockerfile -r test/good-test/Dockerfile --show-json > payload.json
    ```

2. **Test the Policy with Kyverno:**
    ```bash
    kyverno-json scan --payload payload.json --policy check-certificate-python-env-var.yaml
    ```
    a. **Test Policy Against Valid Payload:**
    ```bash
    kyverno-json scan --policy check-certificate-validation-python-env-var.yaml --payload test/good-test/good-payload.json
    ```

    This produces the output:

    ```
    Loading policies ...
    Loading payload ...
    Pre processing ...
    Running ( evaluating 1 resource against 1 policy ) ...
   - check-certificate-validation-python-env-var / check-certificate-validation-python-env-var /  PASSED
    Done
    ```
    b. **Test Policy against Invalid Payload:**
    ```bash
    kyverno-json scan --policy check-certificate-validation-python-env-var.yaml --payload test/bad-test/bad-payload.json
    ```
    This produces the output:
    ```
    Loading policies ...
    Loading payload ...
    Pre processing ...
    Running ( evaluating 1 resource against 1 policy ) ...
   - check-certificate-validation-python-env-var / check-certificate-validation-python-env-var /  FAILED: Ensure certificate validation is enabled by using `PYTHONHTTPSVERIFY` env with value set to `1`: any[0].check.(Stages[].Commands[].Env[?Key=='PYTHONHTTPSVERIFY' && Value=='1'][] | length(@) > `0`): Invalid value: false: Expected value: true
    Done  
    ```
