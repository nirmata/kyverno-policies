      By default Kubernetes allows communications across all pods within a cluster. Network 
      policies and, a CNI that enforces network policies (e.g. Calico, kube-router, etc.), must 
      be used to restrict communinications. A default NetworkPolicy should be configured for 
      each namespace to deny all ingress and egress traffic. Application teams can then configure 
      additional NetworkPolicy resources in their namespace to allow desired traffic.
