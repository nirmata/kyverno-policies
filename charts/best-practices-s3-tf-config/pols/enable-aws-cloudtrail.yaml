      CloudTrail stores Amazon S3 data event logs in an S3 bucket of your choosing.
      Consider using a bucket in a separate AWS account to better organize events from 
      multiple buckets that you might own into a central place for easier querying and
      analysis. AWS Organizations helps you create an AWS account that is linked to 
      the account that owns the bucket that you're monitoring.
