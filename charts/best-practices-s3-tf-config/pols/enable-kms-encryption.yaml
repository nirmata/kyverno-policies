      All Amazon S3 buckets have encryption configured by default,
      and all new objects that are uploaded to an S3 bucket are automatically 
      encrypted at rest. Server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3) 
      is the default encryption configuration for every bucket in Amazon S3. To use a
      different type of encryption, you can either specify the type of server-side encryption
      to use in your S3 PUT requests, or you can set the default encryption configuration in 
      the destination bucket.
