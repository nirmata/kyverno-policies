    policies.kyverno.io/description: >-
      Windows pods offer the ability to run HostProcess containers which enables privileged
      access to the Windows node. Privileged access to the host is disallowed in the baseline
      policy. HostProcess pods are an alpha feature as of Kubernetes v1.22. This policy ensures
      the `hostProcess` field, if present, is set to `false`.
