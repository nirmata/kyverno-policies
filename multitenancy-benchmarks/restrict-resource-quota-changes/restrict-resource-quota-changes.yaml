    policies.kyverno.io/description: >-
      This policy verifies that tenants cannot create, update, patch, delete, or perform 
      bulk-deletion operations on resource quotas within their namespaces. 
      This could be a security measure to prevent tenants from interfering with 
      resource management or exceeding their allocated resources.
