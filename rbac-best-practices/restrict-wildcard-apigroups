      Wildcards ('*') in apiGroups grants access to all of the apiGroups referenced and does not follow the principal of least privilege. As much as possible,
      avoid such open resources unless scoped to perhaps a custom API group.
      This policy blocks any Role or ClusterRole that contains a wildcard entry in the apiGroups list found in any rule.
