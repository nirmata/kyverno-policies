# Pod Security Standards

These are collections of policies which implement the various levels of Kubernetes [Pod Security Standards](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-standards/).

The `Baseline/Default` profile is minimally restrictive and denies the most common vulnerabilities while the `Restricted` profile is more heavily restrictive but follows many more of the common security best practices for Pods.

The preferred way of installing these Pod Security Standard policies is by using Helm.

NOTE: the `proc-mount` pod may execute as non-default values for `securityContext.procMount` require the `ProcMountType` feature flag to be enabled.
