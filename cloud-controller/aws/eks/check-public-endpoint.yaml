    policies.kyverno.io/description: >-
      Disabling the public endpoint minimizes the risk of unauthorized access and potential security breaches by reducing the attack surface of the EKS control plane. 
      It protects against external threats and enforces network segmentation, restricting access to only trusted entities within the network environment. 
      This measure helps organizations meet compliance requirements, maintains operational security, and safeguards the reliability and performance of Kubernetes clusters.
