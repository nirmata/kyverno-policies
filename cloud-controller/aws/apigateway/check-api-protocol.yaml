      APIs can use either the HTTP or WebSocket protocol. HTTP is generally more cost-effective as 
      it is stateless and suitable for typical client-server interactions. WebSocket, while ideal for real-time, 
      low-latency communication, requires persistent connections, which can increase costs. For cost-effectiveness, 
      choose HTTP unless real-time communication is critical to your application.
