      The LogConfiguration property specifies log configuration options to send to a custom log driver for the container. 
      Having all logs at a central place simplifies troubleshooting and debugging since you don't have to log into individual instances
      to access container logs. It also allows integration with monitoring tools to set up metrics and alerts based on log data. 
      This policy checks if ECS TaskDefinitions and Services have logConfiguration defined.
