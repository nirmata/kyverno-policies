      This policy ensures that Amazon ECS Task Definitions do not share the host's process namespace with its containers. 
      If the host's process namespace is shared with containers, it would allow containers to see all of the processes on the host system. 
      This reduces the benefit of process level isolation between the host and the containers. 
      These circumstances could lead to unauthorized access to processes on the host itself, including 
      the ability to manipulate and terminate them. Customers shouldn't share the host's process namespace with containers running on it.
