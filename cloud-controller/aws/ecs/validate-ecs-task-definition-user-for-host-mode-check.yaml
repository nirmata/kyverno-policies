      This policy ensures that ECS task definitions avoid using the root user for the host network mode when privileged is set to false or is not specified. 
      In scenarios where tasks employ the `host` network mode, it's crucial to avoid running containers with the root user (UID 0) for enhanced security. 
      As a recommended security practice, it is recommended to opt for a non-root user.
