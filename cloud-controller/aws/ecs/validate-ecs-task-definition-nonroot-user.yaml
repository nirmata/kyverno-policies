      This policy checks if ECSTaskDefinitions specify a user for 
      Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) EC2 launch type 
      containers to run on. The rule fails if the `user` parameter is not present or is `root`.
      Running containers as non-root users can help prevent running commands with root privileges 
      which adds an extra layer of security by limiting the potential damage a compromised container can do. 
      It also follows the security principle of least privilege, which dictates that applications and processes 
      should operate with minimum privileges necessary to perform their functions.
