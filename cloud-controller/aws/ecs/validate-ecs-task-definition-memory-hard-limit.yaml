      This policy checks if Amazon Elastic Container Service
      (ECS) task definitions and tasks have a set memory limit for its container definitions. 
      If a memory limit is not set for a container, it can consume excessive memory, potentially starving other containers running on the same host. 
      Therefore, it is crucial to enforce a hard memory limit on each container to prevent resource contention. 
      If a container exceeds its memory limit, it will be terminated by ECS.
