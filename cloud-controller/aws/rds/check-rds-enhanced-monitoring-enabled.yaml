      This policy checks whether enhanced monitoring is enabled for an Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) DB instance. 
      The policy fails if enhanced monitoring isn't enabled for the instance. If you provide a custom value for the monitoringInterval parameter, 
      the policy passes only if enhanced monitoring metrics are collected for the instance at the specified interval.
      In Amazon RDS, Enhanced Monitoring enables a more rapid response to performance changes in underlying infrastructure. 
      These performance changes could result in a lack of availability of the data. Enhanced Monitoring provides real-time metrics of the operating system that your RDS DB instance runs on. 
      An agent is installed on the instance. The agent can obtain metrics more accurately than is possible from the hypervisor layer.
