      RDS Proxy can use security mechanisms such as TLS to add an additional layer of security between client applications and the underlying database. 
      Database connections often involve sensitive information, such as personally identifiable information (PII), financial data, or confidential business data. 
      Protecting this data in transit is important to maintain security of the data.
      This policy checks if the RDS Proxy is using TLS.
