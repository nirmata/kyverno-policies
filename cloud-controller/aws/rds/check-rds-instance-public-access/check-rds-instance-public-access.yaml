      The `PubliclyAccessible` value in the RDS instance configuration indicates whether the DB instance is publicly accessible. 
      When the DB instance is configured with `PubliclyAccessible`, it is an Internet-facing instance with a publicly resolvable DNS name, 
      which resolves to a public IP address. When the DB instance isn't publicly accessible, it is an internal instance with a DNS name 
      that resolves to a private IP address. Unless you intend for your RDS instance to be publicly accessible, the RDS instance 
      should not be configured with `PubliclyAccessible` value. Doing so might allow unnecessary traffic to your database instance.
