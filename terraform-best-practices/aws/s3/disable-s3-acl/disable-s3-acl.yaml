      S3 Object Ownership is an Amazon S3 bucket-level setting that
      you can use to control ownership of objects uploaded to your bucket 
      and to disable or enable ACLs. By default, Object Ownership is set to
      the Bucket owner enforced setting and all ACLs are disabled. 
      When ACLs are disabled, the bucket owner owns all the objects in the bucket
      and manages access to data exclusively using access management policies.
