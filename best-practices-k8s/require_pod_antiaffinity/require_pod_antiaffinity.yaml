    policies.kyverno.io/description: >-
      Pod anti-affinity ensures that Pods are not scheduled on the same node or topology
      as other matching Pods, enhancing fault tolerance and availability. This policy validates
      that Pods define either a required or preferred anti-affinity rule using 
      `requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution` or 
      `preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution` with a valid topologyKey.
